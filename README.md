# Motorbike Battery Charger
  
Basically any source of DC 13-13.8 volts can be used to charge a car battery, and even just 12 volts should get it up enough that you can start the engine and charge the rest of the way from the alternator. I've even used a 12 volt wall-wart before, but it took a while. :-)
 
Yes, you can, but you'll have to be patient. There's nothing inherent in a charger that makes it suitable only for motorcycles or cars, although you'll have to be careful with using a 'car' charger on a motorcycle battery to insure the motorcycle battery doesn't get charged too fast and that the charger used is suitable for the battery type.

If your goal is to charge a starter battery to the point where it will **start an engine**, then the other answers are correct: you can use a smaller charger to get enough energy in there to do the job of starting. Be careful not to overcharge. Once the engine is started, you can let the alternator do its job and charge the rest of the way.
 
An alternator's regulator controls what voltage comes out, to satisfy the needs of the electrics in the vehicle and to charge the battery. However, when the alternator is turning very slowly, the voltage will be low regardless of the regulator. Thus, in most vehicles the battery won't charge at idle. Hence, the advice to drive at highway speeds to recharge the battery.
 
Instead of building a small computer to control charging rates, most regulators take a very simple approach to charging, which means you'll never quite get the maximum charge and maximum life out of a battery. It is possible to install a smart regulator, but at $500 it's not worth it in a car. (It may be worth it for off-grid boats, RVs, and houses.)
 
In most cases, you can recharge your motorcycle battery with a trickle charger (also called a battery maintainer.) It will take 1-3 days to charge your motorcycle battery, depending on the charger and how drained your battery was. That said, a slow, gentle charge is the safest way to get the most life out of your motorcycle battery.
 
No. A 12-volt car battery charger that can charge AGM batteries at 1-2 amps would double well as a motorcycle battery charger. If your smart battery charger has the right settings, you can use it for both your car and your motorcycle.
 
If your motorcycle battery is 12 volts, then yes. That said, the charger's voltage should match the battery voltage. You could damage both if you mismatch voltages. Some motorcycles have 6-volt systems, and they would require a 6-volt battery charger or a smart battery charger with a 6-volt setting.

Idling your motorcycle is the least effective way to charge your motorcycle battery. Some motorcycles have an alternator, like a car, for generating power for electricity. Some use a stator. Both require significant RPMs from the engine rotor.
 
We stock a large range of Motorcycle battery chargers from premium brands including Optimate, Accumate, Motobatt, Battery Tender and more, from basic trickle chargers to top of the range smart chargers for lead acid, GEL and lithium batteries.
 
The best answer here is via a good smart charger or battery maintainer. This is an essential tool that every motorcycle owner should have in his garage (along with a multimeter). Not only will it recharge a discharged battery, but it will prevent the battery from getting discharged in the first place when it is used according to manufacturer instructions.
 
Motorcycle and battery manufacturers will tell you that this is not advised, which is sound advice for the most part. A car charging system is way more powerful than a motorcycle and has way too much current for a motorcycle battery to absorb properly.
 
Jumpstarting these is against all lithium battery manufacturer recommendations. Lithium Batteries should not be jumped as they do not take kindly to being fed lots of amperage when excessively discharged. We recommend a smart lithium charger with a safe recovery feature if your lithium battery is discharged.
 
Charge time depends on the depth of discharge, the battery's size, and the charger's amp setting. It is recommended to charge slower rather than faster, so generally expect to plan for a minimum of a couple of hours and as much as 24hrs for a full, complete charge when using a motorcycle charger.
 
**Why does the motorcycle battery need to be charged?**
To put it bluntly, most of you have a car and most of them put their bikes in winter storage. If you ask a motorist whether he or she ever puts his battery on the charger, you will always get the answer 'never!' Why then a motorcycle battery on the charger? Well now, an engine
you use less often than a car. And a motorcycle battery also has a much smaller capacity.
 
All batteries suffer from self-discharge, an annoying process that causes the starting capacity to decrease more and more. Do you think it is strange that a motorcycle battery at the end of winter can barely complete the starter motor? The voltage only needs to drop a little below 12.4 volts and it already goes wrong. And with a very deeply discharged battery, the chance of permanent damage is high. That is why it is important to keep your battery in good condition to prevent a deeply discharged battery.

Every motor vehicle owner will run into the problem of having a dead battery at one point or another. It can be a massive inconvenience for motorcycle riders too, as starting a motorcycle with a dead battery is harder than starting a car with one. Luckily, there are a few different ways you can get your motorcycle temporarily back on the road, giving you enough time to get the battery replaced.
 
A discharged motorcycle battery should be removed and charged externally whenever possible. Onboard charging risks overloading sensitive electronics. Use a smart charger to safely bring the battery to full power without overheating. If the battery no longer holds sufficient charge, replacement is the best option, as trying to revive a damaged cell through desulfation has minimal success. When installing the new battery, carefully connect the positive lead last to avoid short circuits.
 
This will depend on the length of your charger and where your motorcycle is parked, but you can eitherremove the battery to charge it or connect the charger with the battery still on the motorcycle. Werecommend removing the battery before charging. When doing so, make sure you remove the negative cable(usually black) first, before removing the positive cable (usually red).
 
I recently bought an old motorcycle and charged the battery on my trusty automotive style battery charger after it lost charge. After several hours, the water was boiling inside the battery. I'm fairly certain the battery is relatively new and the water level was correct the last time I checked. I didn't have my multimeter at the time so I didn't take any measurements, but the battery is 12V and charger was set to 10A.
 
When charging amperage exceeds the level of the natural absorption rate, the battery may overheat, causing the electrolyte solution to bubble creating flammable hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas, when combined with oxygen from the air, is highly explosive and can easily be ignited by a spark.
 
The electrolyte has a diffusion rate - the rate at which an electrical field can transit through the electrolyte (determined by the state and concentration of the acid). If you force the power by applying a higher voltage (Pressure) the excess energy is taken up in the water molecule and splits it - H and O2The is gassing but not boiling.As above, lower the charge voltage under 14.2 and do not exceed an amperage of 30% of the C10 rate of the battery.
 
U can begin charging on 'engine start. BUT...only for about an hour. Then back down to 'normal' (your charger likely has these two settings). It is normal for bubbles to rise even during normal charge (which exceeds the charge rate of your alternator). Hydrometer tells the truth, if you have one. my issue: charging a battery that has been in car that hasn't been run since 2019. The battery may well be toast.
 
Discharging or charging is always occurring inside a battery at any given time. The electrolyte solution contains charged ions, made up of sulphate and hydrogen. The sulphate ions are negatively charged, while the hydrogen ions have a positive charge.
 
In addition to the electron flow within the battery as it discharges, the ratio of sulphuric acid to water in the electrolyte solution is also changing to more water and less acid. A chemical by-product of this process is lead sulphate that coats the battery plates within each cell reducing its surface area.
 
Colder storage temperatures are best for long-term storage. For example, an AGM battery stored at 0C holds 90% of its capacity for about 6 months. The same battery stored at 40C loses 50% of its capacity in 4 months. On-board computers, clocks and other accessories can also drain a battery over time.
 
Because of their smaller size, when compared to automotive types of batteries, powersports batteries are more sensitive to how much current they can safely absorb. When charging a motorcycle or other small battery, the battery charger should not exceed 3 amps. Most automotive types of battery chargers are not suitable due to higher current output. While maintaining a battery at its full state-of charge will ensure optimum life, overcharging may significantly reduce it.
